# THE-SNAKE-GAME

This is a project developed by Rishik Raj and Saurav Sinha for our computer graphics subject project in our 6th semester. The game is a Windows application of the classic 3-D Snake game and is completely built in C++ using the OpenGL/glut library, which provided the necessary graphics and game development tools.
